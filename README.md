# Sexagenary Cycle Converter

In today's Chinese class, we were learning about traditional Chinese culture, specifically the section on calendars. The teacher mentioned a method of year designation called the "Ganzhi Calendar" (Sexagenary Cycle), which differs from the Lunar Calendar and the Gregorian Calendar. The Ganzhi Calendar uses a combination of 10 Heavenly Stems (Tiangan) and 12 Earthly Branches (Dizhi) to designate years. After class, the teacher posed a question: how can we quickly calculate the Ganzhi year? Since one of my hobbies is computer programming, I decided to set up a project to solve the teacher's question using computational methods.

# 干支纪年转换器
今天语文课上在学习中国传统文化的历法板块时，老师提到了一种纪叫做干支纪年的纪年法，不同于农历和公历，干支纪年法采用10个天干和12个地支来组合纪年。课后老师提了一个问题，如何快速计算干支纪年。我的业余爱好之一是计算机，于是打算设立一个项目用计算机的方法来解决老师的问题。
